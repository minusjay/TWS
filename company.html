		      		<h1>Company Info</h1>

					<p>Trace Web Solutions is a small company based in the United States. We create sites for anyone or any business; from an individual's personalized website to a small business to global corporations. We not only create sites, but will host and maintain them for you as well. Or we can build the site so that you can easily manipulate and maintain it yourself, if you choose to.</p>

					<p>The philosophy here at Trace is to keep things simple and to the point. We are a small company, which makes it easy for us to work with our customers on a personal level. This also means that we are flexible and easily accessible for guidance and advice.</p>

					<h1>Company History</h1>

					<p>We started a company we would want to work for and with. Trace Web Solutions was created by four internet technicians working for a global corporation. Essentially we all became tired of the corporate bureaucracy which hindered creative development, the amount of work able to get done and the evolution of the team as a whole. We realized that between the four of us on the team, we had all the tools necessary to create a successful company with no limits.</p>
